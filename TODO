- Make sure only n total peers and implement two-key sorting using hash of ID
- Manage cache with go routine or other helper function
- Any performance improvements by setting capacity of slice in advance?
- Add README
- How much time does cache save in realistic data?
- Make sure output matches output of Python version
- Break up work into chunks even within groups so that processor time is more evenly used
- Optimize caching (don't store more than you need; delete it when you know you no longer need it)
